Python Twitter Tools
====================

The Minimalist Twitter API for Python is a Python API for Twitter,
everyone's favorite Web 2.0 Facebook-style status updater for people
on the go.

Also included is a twitter command-line tool for getting your friends'
tweets and setting your own tweet from the safety and security of your
favorite shell and an IRC bot that can announce Twitter updates to an
IRC channel.

For more information, after installing the `twitter` egg:

 * import the `twitter` package and run help() on it
 * run `twitter -h` for command-line tool help
 * run `twitterbot -h` for IRC bot help

The Command-Line Tool
=====================

The command-line tool currently supports the following things:

 * view your friends' recent tweets
 * view your recent replies
 * view the public timeline
 * follow and unfollow (leave) friends
 * various output formats for tweet information
 * read your username and password from a config file
 
The bottom line: type `twitter`, receive tweets.



The IRC Bot
===========

The IRC bot is associated with a twitter account (either your own account or an
account you create for the bot). The bot announces all tweets from friends
it is following. It can be made to follow or leave friends through IRC /msg
commands.
