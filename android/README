Android client app for the personal location tracker running on 
Google AppEngine, keeping track of your location.

Compile the application using Eclipse, and either install it directly
on the phone (for ADP phones) or make an APK and install that.
Note that currently LocationTrackerService.java needs to be modified
with Google credentials and correct appengine paths (this will be
sorted out and moved to the GUI soon).
